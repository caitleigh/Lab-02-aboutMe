            <h2>A little about me</h2>
            <div>
                <p> <img class="headshot" src="Cait.jpg"> My name is <span class="Cait">Cait</span> and I'm a student at Code Fellows... but hopefully you know that by now. I was raised in Gig Harbor, Washington. While growing up in GH I danced for about 8 years including ballet, jazz, hip hop, lyrical and tap, but my primary focus was ballet. Eventually, I grew a little too quickly and my body no longer let me dance at the level I wanted to. I was also 13 and wanted some semblance of life. </p>

                <p>Then came sports. After I finished dancing I joined a soccer team and the track team. Turns out I was pretty okay at sports. I juggled several sports over the course of junior high and my freshman year of high school where I finally settled on Track and Field and eventually went to run at the collegiate level, where I won a conference championship my senior year.</p>

                <p>Now that I'm no longer a track star and my hips and knees are shot, I spend my time with friends, my cat who is named Bruce, and as much time boating as possible. So there it is... a little about me, <span class="Cait">Cait</span>!</p>
